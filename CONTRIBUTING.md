# Contributing Guidelines

## Make sure to go through all the sections in README.md

To contribute to this repository and add cool code snippets, the following pointers should be kept in mind to avoid merge conflicts and other problems such as a bad PR while contributing:

1. Create a markdown file with a suitable name according to your snippet. Make sure the code snippet is not already in the codebase and is in the correct sub-directory.
2. Write appropriate title and sub-titles following the style in the already existing files inside the folders.
3. Add the snippet and output in the appropriate block. For example, for a python snippet:
    ~~~
    ```python
    print("A cool code snippet here")
    ```
    ~~~
4. You can add a **Description** sub-heading if you want to provide an explanation! 
5. Add a **Contributed By** sub-heading at the end of the file and add your name, GitHub username and institute name in a tabular format in the markdown file.

## Do not add pure code files, add your snippets in the code blocks in the markdown file.
